## Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered)
Conceptual Understanding:
 
### Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?

```
- No, I'm not familiar about the Onion Architecture Principle when it comes to software designing.
```

### Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
 
```
 - Yes, I have a vague knowledge about MVC when it comes to implementing it, im not accustomed to it.
```
 
### Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?

 ```
- No, I never heard of ASP.NET Core Web API to build Restful APIs.
 ```

###Application & Bottlenecks: Onion Architecture:
 
### 1.Benefits: (1-3 keywords) Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)

```
1.Separation of concerns
2.Testability: 
3.Maintainability
```

### Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)

```
- Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects offers benefits such as clear separation of concerns, improved testability, maintainability, and flexibility in adapting to changing requirements.
```

### Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)

 ```
- 
While Onion Architecture offers numerous benefits, challenges can arise, including potential increased complexity for simpler projects, the need for developers familiar with the pattern, and initial setup overhead, especially for teams transitioning from other architectural styles.
```

### MVC: Components: (1-3 keywords each)

```
1.Model
2.View
3.Controller
```

### Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.

```
1. Model: Serves as a representation of your application's data and main logic. It manages business rules, data access, and any necessary computations.
2. View: Concentrates on the user's presentation of the data. It only has information-display UI elements; no application logic is present.
3. Controller: Serves as a go-between for the View and the Model. It takes in input from the user, makes necessary updates to the Model, and tells the View how to update itself in response to those changes.
```

### Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)
 
```
-Yes, The challenge I encountered is knowing how to connect between the model and controller in MVC projects
```

### Web API: ## Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

```
- No, No Idea about Web API.
```

### Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.

```
- No, Still no Idea about Web API.
```

### Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)

```
-No, Still can't differentiate the difference due to lack of understanding abotu the topic.
```
